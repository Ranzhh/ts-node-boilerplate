# TS-Node-Boilerplate

TS-Node-Boilerplate is a simple repository containing the files I usually end up with when creating a Typescript + Node.js project. It has compile-and-run features using [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) and allows for live changes with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). You're free to use this project under the terms of the [GNU General Public License 3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

### Usage
Simply edit the files in `/src/`, then launch a live compile session with `npm start` or compile and then run using `tsc` followed by a `nodemon lib/index.js`.
